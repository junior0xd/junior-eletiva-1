    <h2 class="fs-4"> The Police</h2>
    <p class="fs-6">Every breath you take
        <br> And every move you make
        <br> Every bond you break
        <br> Every step you take
        <br> I'll be watching you
    </p>
    <p class="fs-6">Every single day
        <br> And every word you say
        <br> Every game you play
        <br> Every night you stay
        <br> I'll be watching you
    </p>
    <p class="fs-6">Oh, can't you see
        <br> You belong to me
        <br> How my poor heart aches
        <br> With every step you take?
    </p>
    <p class="fs-6">Every move you make
        <br> And every vow you break
        <br> Every smile you fake
        <br> Every claim you stake
        <br> I'll be watching you
    </p>
    <p class="fs-6">Since you've gone I've been lost without a trace
        <br> I dream at night, I can only see your face
        <br> I look around but it's you I can't replace
        <br> I feel so cold and I long for your embrace
        <br> I keep crying baby, baby please
    </p>
    <p class="fs-6"> Oh, can't you see
