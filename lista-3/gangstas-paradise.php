    <h1 class="fs-2"> Gangsta's Paradise</h1>
    <h2 class="fs-4"> Coolio</h2>
    <p class="fs-6">As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
        <br> I take a look at my life and realize there's nothin' left
        <br> 'Cause I've been blastin' and laughin' so long that
        <br> Even my mama thinks that my mind is gone
    </p>
    <p class="fs-6">But I ain't cross a man that didn't deserve it
        <br> Me be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of
        <br> You better watch how you're talkin' and where you're walkin'
        <br> Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk
    </p>
    <p class="fs-6">I really hate to trip but I gotta loc
        <br> As they croak, I see myself in the pistol smoke, fool
        <br> I'm the kinda G that little homies wanna be like
        <br> On my knees in the night, sayin' prayers in the street light
    </p>
    <p class="fs-6">Been spendin' most their lives
        <br> Livin' in the gangsta's paradise (x4)
    </p>

    <p class="fs-6"> Look at the situation they got me facin'
        <br> I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the state
        <br> So I gotta be down with the hood team
        <br> Too much television watchin' got me chasin' dreams
    </p>

    <p class="fs-6"> I'm an educated fool with money on my mind
        <br> Got my ten in my hand and a gleam in my eye
        <br> I'm a loc'd out gangsta, set trippin' banger
        <br> And my homies is down so don't arouse my anger
    </p>

    <p class="fs-6">Fool, Death ain't nothin' but a heartbeat away
        <br> I'm livin' life do or die, what can I say?
        <br> I'm twenty-three now, but will I live to see twenty-four?
        <br> The way things is goin' I don't know
    </p>

    <p class="fs-6"> Tell me why are we so blind to see
        <br> That the ones we hurt are you and me?
    </p>

    <p class="fs-6">Been spendin' most their lives
        <br> Livin' in the gangsta's paradise (x4)
    </p>

    <p class="fs-6"> Power and the money, money and the power
        <br> Minute after minute, hour after hour
        <br> Everybody's runnin', but half of them ain't lookin'
        <br> It's goin' on in the kitchen, but I don't know what's cookin'
    </p>

    <p class="fs-6"> They say I gotta learn, but nobody's here to teach me
        <br> If they can't understand it, how can they reach me?
        <br> I guess they can't, I guess they won't
        <br> I guess they front, that's why I know my life is out of luck, fool
    </p>
